# The minimum workable settings - set openai.key to your API key.
# Set github.deployment_type to "user" and github.user_token to your GitHub personal access token.
# This will allow you to run the CLI scripts in the scripts/ folder and the github_polling server.
#
# See README for details about GitHub App deployment.
